# CNN Convolution Animation

This project demonstrates the real-time visualization of convolution in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using Python.

## Features:
- Visualizes a 3x3 kernel sliding over a real image (Chelsea the cat üê±).
- Animated output showing the convolution process and feature map formation.
- Learn how convolution works step-by-step in CNNs.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Python code to see the animation in action.

## Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- opencv
